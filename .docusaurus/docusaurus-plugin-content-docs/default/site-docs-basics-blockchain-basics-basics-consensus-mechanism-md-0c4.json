  "title": "Consensus Mechanism",
  "description": "On the blockchain, the consensus mechanism is like the law of a country, maintaining the normal operation of the blockchain world. In the blockchain system, everyone will have a ledger that records all transactions on the chain. When a new transaction is generated on the chain, since the time for each person to receive the transaction is different, some malicious ones could use this and publish wrong transactions. The goal of the consensus mechanism is to make all honest nodes save only correct transaction data.",
