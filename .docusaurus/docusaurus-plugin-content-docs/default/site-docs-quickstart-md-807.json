  "description": "BitTorrent Chain (referred to as “BTTC” below) is the first scalable heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol on TRON, featuring PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism and multi-node validation. It supports smart contract extension through sidechains and is compatible with Ethereum-based smart contracts.
