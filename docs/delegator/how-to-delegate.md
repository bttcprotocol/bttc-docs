# How To Delegate

Delegators do not need to participate in verification without a full node. They can vote BTT tokens for validators and receive proportional rewards. Delegators play a vital role in the system and they can choose validators according to their wishes.


There are no prerequisites to becoming a delegator on the BitTorrent chain, all you have to do is have a TRON account.

This chapter will introduce operations related to pledge voting, which can help delegators operate on BTTC more conveniently and quickly.

Switch to TRON mainnet in your wallet like Tronlink and login [BTTC Staking Page](https://wallet.bt.io/staking). Then, you may see a list of validators with statistics.
